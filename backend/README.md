## Tools

The use of the following is mandatory:

- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- Prisma
- SQLite

## Environment Variables

Every project has several environment variables that change depending on the environment where it runs. For that reason, it’s important to clearly and easily identify which variables are required.

This project must include a `.env.example` file with the necessary keys:

> - JWT_SECRET=
> - DATABASE_URL=
> - CORS_ORIGINS=
> - PORT=
> - NODE_ENV=

If you add additional variables, remember to include them in the .env.example file.

## Optional

Make sure to follow all mandatory requirements, especially those related to technologies such as GraphQL. However, you’ve learned many concepts throughout your postgraduate journey, and if you want an extra challenge, you may apply best practices and DevOps concepts.

Just remember to configure the entire environment so the application can be run locally.

## Tips

Don’t forget to enable CORS in the application.

If you have questions, use the community space and forum to interact with other students and instructors and find a solution that works for you.
