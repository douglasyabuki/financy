## Description and Requirements

In this front-end project, you will build a **React application** that works together with an API to manage **transactions** and **categories**.

## Features and Rules

As with the API, the application must support the following features and rules:

- [x] Users can create an account and log in
- [x] Users can view and manage **only** their own transactions and categories
- [x] Users can create a transaction
- [x] Users can delete a transaction
- [x] Users can edit a transaction
- [x] Users can list all transactions
- [x] Users can create a category
- [x] Users can delete a category
- [x] Users can edit a category
- [x] Users can list all categories

In addition, there are some front-end–specific requirements:

- [x] You must create a **React application** using **GraphQL** to query the API and **Vite** as the bundler
- [x] Follow the **Figma layout** as closely as possible

> 💡 Tip: Copy the checklist above into your project’s README.  
> This makes it easier to track your progress as you implement each feature.

## Pages

The application has **6 pages** and **two modal dialogs** containing forms.

- The root page (`/`) displays:
  - A **login screen** when the user is not authenticated
  - A **dashboard** when the user is authenticated

## Tools

The use of the following tools is **required**:

- TypeScript
- React
- Vite (without a framework)
- GraphQL

The use of the following tools is **optional**:

- TailwindCSS
- Shadcn
- React Query
- React Hook Form
- Zod

## Tips

- Start the project with the **Style Guide** tab in Figma. This helps you define your theme, fonts, and components early, making page creation much smoother later on.
- User experience (UX) matters, but **developer experience (DX)** matters too. Even though it’s possible to build this app without additional libraries, we recommend using some to speed up development and simplify maintenance.
- If you have questions, use the community space or forum to talk with other students and instructors and find a solution that works for you.

## Want to go further?

If you want an extra challenge and explore concepts beyond the required scope, here are a few ideas to inspire you:

> ⚠️ The evaluation of your challenge considers **only** the mandatory rules and features listed above.  
> Submit your project for review before adding extra features (or create a new branch with your changes).

- **Image upload**: Adding a profile image upload for the user avatar is optional, but it’s a great way to practice what you’ve learned and push yourself further.
